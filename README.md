## Introduction to Spring core

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. 
The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. 
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. 
The Spring Framework is open source.

Spring framework consists of many components to facilitate many aspects of Java application.

* Application Context and Dependency Injection.
* Easy and efficient access to the database.
* Component for web application development in Java(Spring MVC).

Spring is a Java-based framework that provides a number of features and components for building Java applications, 
including support for IoC and DI. **Spring's IoC and DI** capabilities allow developers to build applications using a loosely coupled, modular approach, 
which can make the application more flexible and easier to maintain.

* In the context of the Spring framework, **Inversion of Control (IoC)** refers to the design principle in which an object's behavior is governed by an external entity rather than being hard-coded within the object itself. 
This is typically achieved through dependency injection, where the external entity provides an object with its dependencies, rather than the object creating them itself.

* **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a specific implementation of **IoC** that involves injecting the dependencies that an object requires into the object at runtime, rather than the object creating them itself. 
This allows the object to be more loosely coupled with its dependencies and makes it easier to change or swap out those dependencies at runtime.
